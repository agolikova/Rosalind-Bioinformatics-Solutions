#Given: Two DNA strings s and t in FASTA format that share some short inexact repeat r of 32-40 bp
#By "inexact", meant that r may appear with slight modifications (each repeat differing by â‰¤3 changes/indels)
#Return: Total number of occurrences of r as substring of s, followed by  total number of occurrences of r as substring of t

#Use this tool to identify shared repeat: https://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta_www2/fasta_www.cgi
#Gap open penalty set to -60
#Gap extend penalty set to -30
#Identify repeat of 32-40 bp with highest % match
#Save repeat seq as "rosalind_subo_repeat.txt"

#Use Hamming distance to count no. of times repeat occurs in s & t, with each occurrence differing by <= 3 changes
